## What is the difference betwen SIP and SERVAL: 
[Forwarded from Emanuele Sorce comment on Telegram 11 March 2018]

"SIP is a voice protocol - VOIP, voice over IP or SIP phone, designed for STANDARD INTERNET protocols that makes possible to communicate freely with people over the internet, with voice, video, and text instant messaging.

SERVAL is a software that creates a STANDALONE NETWORK out of nodes using wifi, bluetooth and/or radio. 
Single phone/tablet devices can connect with wifi or bluetooth to create a LOCAL MESH, and long range radio extenders can be used to create more powerful and extended networks.

On top of the SERVAL MESH Network there are some protocols to do calls/messaging/file sharing/... these are different from standard ones (such as SIP).

So the only common aspect is that both make sound out of a speaker."
