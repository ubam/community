# UBports Q&A Transcript Guidelines
*This pad describes the process of transcribing the UBports Q&A as a community effort. It can be adapted for transcription of any other event.*

## Transcription Process

1.	Preparation
	- Use the *same* prepared pad for every transcript: [papad.org/p/UBports_Q&A_transcript](https://papad.org/p/UBports_Q&A_transcript)
	- Make sure the last transcription is fully migrated (else resume at the appropriate point in 3. ASAP)
	- Empty/replace with template, fill in date, episode # and links
	- Make a Call For Action asking people to contribute.

> **Ideally there should be only 3 to 8 transcriptors to prevent chaos.** Ask people to ~~leave~~ sit back and watch if they steal each others notes.

2.	Transcription
	- **Pay attention to the rules at the top**
	- The key points explained should be noted semantically intendented per topic, as indicated by the template.

	> Adding a line break at the very end of a line can sill cause the cursor of another person to move over to the new line. A person currently transcribing on a line also should not be interrupted by adding information to the end of the line.

	- Idle transcriptors can go back and fix errors or expand with more detailed information, but should keep in mind that the transcript is intended to be used as informative shownotes. Insights into personal lives should be included with more than a single keypoint.
3.	Post processing and publishing
	- After the Q&A ended, the YouTube livestream becomes like any other video on the platform. Now displaying time signatures relative to the start of the video instead of to the current live point in time enables the addition of timestamps per topic to the transcription.
	- The pads contents (excluding the rules, so everything below *########*) is to be submitted to [ubam/community/transcripts/qna](https://github.com/ubam/community/tree/master/transcripts/qna) in the form of a markdown document following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD_XX.md` (where `XX` stands for the episode #).
	- Translations of these transcriptions are welcome and to be placed with the same name in a sub-directory named as the language code (`de/`, `tr/` etc.).

## Pad Template

> Rules:
> 	- Try to always make a new line for your edit so you don't accidently interrupt each other, always leave (at least) two or three blank lines to the bottom, so others can edit
> 	- Edits and corrections/improvements on each others notes are nice, but shouldn't be too aggressive (you might be wrong, too — better address unsure/errors afterwards)
> 	- Comments and such will be left in for a bit but edited out eventually
