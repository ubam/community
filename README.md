## What this repo is about

Welcome to the Community repo, where UBAM gathers revelant and interesting things by members of the community. Here fits anything that touches on Ubuntu Touch or expands on an existing How To for UT, like the [Installing NextCloud on the RPI]() alongside [NextCloud integration on UT]().

## How stuff is organized in this repo

All documents about a certain topic are to be placed in the same directory. This Repository should follow the general conventions of informational (non-code) UBAM repositories:

- All directories and files that are not `.md` documents (and thus not immediately viewable) can have only small letters and contain no spaces or special symbols (which may be replaced with an underscore `_`).
- `.md` document names can contain capital letters at the start of words (or in CamelCase), which can be separated by underscores instead of spaces. Special symbols are discouraged.
- Usually, `.md` documents carry a top level headline that repeats their name (without the `.md`), in case of a `README.md` this is the name of their parent directory or repository, capitalized as a `.md` name would be.
- Every directory is generally encouraged to contain a `README.md`, explaining at least what the directory is all about (e.g. nextcloud: what is nextcloud, relation to UT of the contained docs).

This repository can contain files like shell scripts, but should focus on providing explanations and tutorials. Arrangements that could be viewed as independent small programming projects should be hosted somewhere else and only be linked to from here.
